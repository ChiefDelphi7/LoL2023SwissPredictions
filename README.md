# LoL2023SwissPredictions

See the attatched Excel file for an interactive prediction model for the Worlds swiss stage. A few assumptions:
1. Single games in a BO3 are assumed to be independent.
2. Whoever wins the BDS / GGS match will make the swiss stage (this can be modified if you disagree).
3. Matchups after the first round will be truly random, and the only restriction on first-round matchups is that you can't face another team from your region.
