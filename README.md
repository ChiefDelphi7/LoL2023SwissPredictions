# LoL2023SwissPredictions

See the attatched Excel file for an interactive prediction model for the Worlds swiss stage. A few assumptions:
1. Single games in a BO3 are assumed to be independent.
2. Matchups after the first round will be truly random.

The v2 version of the predictions file has been updated to reflect the results of the Swiss draw.
